# kc2bez
## What does that mean?
kc2bez is my [amateur radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio) callsign. Sometimes amateur radio is referred to ham radio as well. I have been a licensed amateur since 1997. It is a great hobby and I have met some facinating people along the way. 

## Why do I use that for a username?
When hams call each other they use their callsign rather than their name. Often it just becomes second nature to use that.
